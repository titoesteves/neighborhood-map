Project 5
===============================

Welcome to the neighborhood map project. Double click index.html to open the site. This project includes google maps api to add the following: google map markers, google infowindows, and google map animations. I used knockout for the data bindings. I used bootstrap to make the site responsive. I also used wikipedia api to display associated data.
